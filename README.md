# MissileCommand
This is a opensource multiplayer remake of the 1980's version of Missile Command on the Atari. I wanted to keep the retro game style, with minial effects and graphics. I was inspired to make this game so my dad and I could play some sort of video game together. He doesnt really play any video games and this is the only game he plays still.

I created this game in C# using Monogame as the framework. https://www.monogame.net/

In order to create the multiplayer functionality I used the Lidgren Network Library https://github.com/lidgren/lidgren-network-gen3

The game is still not complete. There is no single player mode yet. It would be simple to create though. One would just have to create a new game state that would be initialized during the menu screen phase. 

One other thing I still need to make is the alien ships that come down and avoid missiles fired by the player.
